# C++ Track

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the exercises in the
[![C++ Track](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++Track%20-%2300599C.svg?style=flat&logo=c%2B%2B&logoColor=white)](https://exercism.org/tracks/cpp) on [Exercism](https://exercism.org/).

## Why Am I Learning C++?

Simply because I want to learn how to write fast code. I'm also
interested in learning how to write code that is portable across
different platforms.
I'm also such involved in competitive programming and C++ is the
language of choice for most competitive programmers due to its
performance and the STL.
